# Group Assignment: Component Implementation and Collaboration

## Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to implement the components you decomposed in the previous task using fake data. This will help you learn how to efficiently split the work within a team, manage your code with branches, and practice collaborative coding through pull requests and code reviews.

## Instructions:

1. **Task Setup:**
   - You will work with the same websites as in the previous assignment.
   - Choose one page and assign each team member specific components to implement based on the decomposition you previously created.
   - Each team member should implement at least one component.

2. **Workflow:**
   - Create a new branch for each team member based on the task/component they are working on. Each member should work in their respective branch.

3. **Component Implementation:**
   - Each member must implement their assigned components using fake/mock data (e.g., hardcoded arrays).
   - Components should be functional, reusable, and maintainable.
   - Follow best practices, such as separating concerns and organizing code effectively.

4. **Collaboration Workflow:**
   - After completing your component, submit a pull request (PR) to merge your branch into the main branch.
   - Each PR should be reviewed by at least one other group member. Reviewers should check for code quality, adherence to component design, and ensure that the component works with others.
   - After feedback is incorporated and the PR is approved, merge the branch.

5. **Testing:**
   - Ensure that all components work together in the main branch after merging.
   - Fix any bugs or integration issues that arise.

6. **Deliverables:**
   - A working (runnable) project.
   - A short report outlining how the tasks were divided between team members.

## Evaluation Criteria:
- Proper use of Git branches and pull requests.
- Quality and reusability of components.
- Collaboration and teamwork, as reflected in the division of work and the code review process.
- Functionality of the final merged project.
